# ADAC-Car-Seat-Safety-Ratings

ADAC is a vehicle insurance company that tests the safety of car seats to standards that far exceed the standard EU regulations.

You can browse the results here: [https://www.adac.de/...](https://www.adac.de/rund-ums-fahrzeug/ausstattung-technik-zubehoer/kindersitze/kindersitztest/)

Unfortunately, you can only filter the results by a few categories. This script remedies that.

Scrapes all child car seats tested by adac.de and outputs them to a DataFrame and/or Excel. This allows you to filter by any tracked category, not only the few parameters allowed by ADAC.
